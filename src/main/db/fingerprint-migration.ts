// 034 — perceptual fingerprints (#650). Recomputable index metadata over the
// photo's own mid derivative, one row per photo: either the four rotation
// hashes or a deferral reason, never both. Freshness is judged against the
// row's derivative key and content hash (a Duplicate's own key, #496) plus
// the algorithm version, so a re-imported or re-keyed photo is re-indexed
// and an algorithm change requeues the library. The row dies with the photo
// (cascade) and is never part of the backup manifest — it is derived data in
// the ADR-0034 §6 sense, rebuilt from photos the manifest already carries.
