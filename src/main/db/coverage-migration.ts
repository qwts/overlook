// 035 — backup coverage (#506, ADR-0033 §1/§2). A ledger row is `included`
// by default; `excluding` is the durable intermediate ADR-0033 §2 requires
// between "the user decided" and "the provider copy is gone"; `excluded`
// rows are local-only by choice. Automatic backup, pending counts and
// integrity reporting read only included rows — an excluded photo is not
// pending, not dirty-counted and not a remote-presence expectation.
// `coverage_origin` records who decided (the user, the protected domain, or
// a provider that cannot hold the asset) and `coverage_since` when.
