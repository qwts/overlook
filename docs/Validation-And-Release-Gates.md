# Validation And Release Gates

Gate-by-gate detail behind `AGENTS.md` → **Validation**. That file states the
rules; this one states what each gate checks, why the ratchets point the way they
do, and which policies exist only as prose. See also
[Testing Strategy](./Testing-Strategy.md) for the test lanes themselves and
[ADR-0001](./adr/ADR-0001-Automation-Check-Governance.md) for the governance
model.

## The chain

`npm run ci` runs the same non-browser gates CI enforces, in order: interop
acceptance → the lint chain → `format:check` → `check:changesets` →
`check:acceptance-coverage` → `check:a11y-budget` → `docs:gov` → `test:cov` →
`build`. Browser lanes (`test:e2e`, `test:stories:ci`) run separately and are
required for E2E- and renderer-relevant changes.

Two gates need an external checkout, both env-gated in the same shape:

| Variable                   | Points at                                                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DOCS_GOV_TOOLING_ROOT`    | a `qwts/playbook-engineering` checkout with `tools/docs-gov` at `v1`  |
| `INTEROP_IMAGE_TRAIL_ROOT` | a `qwts/image-trail` checkout pinned to the commit the manifest names |

## Documentation governance (`docs:gov`)

The deterministic docs-gov check gates `docs/` and the root agent files against
link, orphan, stale-path, heading, token-budget, and anti-pattern rules per
`docs-gov.config.json`
([ENG-0009](https://github.com/qwts/playbook-engineering/blob/master/docs/decisions/ENG-0009-documentation-governance-gate.md)).

Its implementation is **not vendored**. It lives once in
`qwts/playbook-engineering` and both halves run it at the `v1` tag: CI via the
reusable workflow `.github/workflows/docs-governance.yml@v1` (the required
`Docs governance / docs-gov` status context), and locally via
`scripts/check-docs-gov.mjs`. The local wrapper verifies the checkout's
`tools/docs-gov` is byte-identical to `v1`, so a local pass proves what a CI pass
proves. Raising a token budget always records a `reason` in the config.

## Ratchets

Floors only ever move in the direction that makes the codebase stricter:

| Ratchet                                                    | Current                   | Direction    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| c8 coverage (`.c8rc.json`)                                 | lines 90 / branches 80    | only up      |
| `type-coverage --at-least`                                 | 99.8, strict, per project | only up      |
| File size (ESLint `max-lines` + `check-new-file-size.mjs`) | 800 lines                 | only down    |
| a11y violation budget (`tests/a11y/violation-budget.json`) | per surface               | only smaller |
| `AGENTS.md` length (`check-agent-context.mjs`)             | see the script's constant | only smaller |

The a11y budget is the same policy inverted: its counts only ever **shrink**, and
a surface that comes in **under** budget fails until the entry is tightened or
deleted. Unlisted surfaces are budgeted at zero. Never lower a floor to make a
build pass.

## Accessibility runs in three lanes

None of them subsumes the others:

- **`jsx-a11y`** (strict, `src/renderer`) reads the **source**, so pointer-only
  handlers and label/control mismatches fail at authoring time;
- the **story lane** runs axe over every story;
- the **E2E lane** runs axe over composed flows plus the focus-obscured probe for
  SC 2.4.11, which has no axe rule.

A story-lane pass proves nothing about composition, and an axe pass proves
nothing about criteria axe does not implement — roughly two thirds of WCAG. The
[Accessibility Audit](./Accessibility-Audit-2026-07.md) records which criteria
are gated and which rest on the manual pass.

**Never suppress an a11y rule bare.** `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` is `error`,
so every `eslint-disable` must carry a reason: either why the code is verified
correct, or the issue that owns the debt. When the fix lands the directive stops
matching and the build fails until it is deleted — that is the ratchet applied to
exemptions. A blanket `rules: {'jsx-a11y/x': 'off'}` needs the same justification
as lowering a coverage floor.

## Licenses

`lint:licenses` (part of the `lint` chain) audits the **shipped** dependency
closure — production deps of `dependencies` / `optionalDependencies` plus the
bundled `electron` runtime, per `scripts/dependency-closure.mjs`, **not**
`devDependencies` — against the SPDX allowlist in `.license-policy.json`. The
same step verifies `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` is not stale.

A new or upgraded dependency with a non-allowlisted or undeclared license fails
CI until it is allowlisted or given a reviewed `exceptions` entry with a reason;
then run `npm run licenses:notices` to refresh attributions. A CycloneDX SBOM
(`npm run licenses:sbom`) is emitted into `release/` by the `package*` scripts.

## Dependency policy

Dependencies use **exact pins**; Dependabot is the only actor that bumps
versions (`scripts/check-package-pins.mjs` enforces this). A set of **toolchain
caps** holds back majors that would break the build — TypeScript below 6.1.0
(typescript-eslint's peer cap), `@types/node` tracking the `.nvmrc` runtime major,
Electron on the prebuilt-ABI major, and Vite / `@vitejs/plugin-react` / React held
until `electron-vite` supports Vite 8 and React 19 is migrated deliberately. Each
is a Dependabot ignore; `.github/dependabot.yml` is the source of truth for the
exact bounds and removal conditions.

Four overrides exist, each with a removal condition:

- **`axe-core`** is pinned exact and overridden into `axe-playwright` (which
  depends on a floating range). Its rule set _defines_ the a11y violation-budget
  counts, so an unpinned bump would move every number with no diff naming the
  cause. A Dependabot bump of it is _expected_ to move counts: re-audit and
  re-baseline in that PR (`OVERLOOK_A11Y_REPORT=<path> npm run test:stories:ci`),
  never widen the tags or raise a budget to make it pass.
- **`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`** is overridden onto `$eslint`. Its latest release
  caps its peer at ESLint 9 and this repo is on 10, so npm refuses the install
  without the override. The rules were verified to actually run under ESLint 10 —
  this is a stale peer range, not an incompatibility. If a bump ever breaks rule
  execution the symptom is jsx-a11y silently reporting **nothing**, so treat a
  sudden drop to zero findings as a failure, not a win.
- **`shell-quote`** is overridden to 1.9.0 because `concurrently` pins vulnerable
  1.8.4 (CVE-2026-13311). Remove when `concurrently` adopts 1.9.0 or later and
  its Storybook orchestration lane passes without the override.
- **`uuid`** is overridden to 11.1.1 because `@storybook/test-runner` resolves
  vulnerable 8.3.2 through `jest-junit` and `nyc` (CVE-2026-41907). Remove when
  the Storybook testing stack resolves only unaffected versions, the
  interaction/report lane passes without it, and the security scan stays clean.

## Packaging checks

- The macOS package job loads the native HEIC decoder from the packaged app and
  decodes the checked-in iPhone fixture. Keep
  `scripts/verify-macos-heic-preview.mjs` and its readiness marker current when
  changing the native bridge, package layout, Electron ABI, or HEIC fixtures.
- The Windows arm64 leg re-resolves the target-arch sharp binary with `npm pack`
  and **verifies the downloaded tarball's sha512 against the exact
  `package-lock.json` integrity entry before extraction** — registry metadata is
  never trusted on its own. `tests/tooling/windows-signing.test.ts` locks the
  gate; keep both in step when changing sharp packaging or the lockfile shape.

## Changesets and releases

Every PR includes its own semantic changeset (`npx changeset`); an empty
governance marker cannot satisfy the draft `Changesets` gate. The gate validates
syntax and requires a newly added entry with a `major`, `minor`, or `patch`
release, so pending changesets on `main` never satisfy a new PR. 0.x semantics
(minor = behavior-changing, patch = fixes) are
[ADR-0035](./adr/ADR-0035-Changeset-Presence-Before-Review.md). `CHANGELOG.md`
is generated by `npm run changeset:version` — never hand-edit it. The generated
Version packages PR is the sole presence-check exception: it consumes the
reviewed changesets into the release projection before opening the PR.

Releases are cut by merging the bot-maintained **Version packages** PR, which the
version-cut workflow keeps current while changesets are pending. That merge is
validated once through the normal ready lifecycle after the governed branch
updater makes it current. Version-cut waits for the exact main-push `CI` gate and
dispatches no equivalent suite before tagging `v0.x.y`.

Release publication fails closed unless the tag is on `main`, version and
changeset state match, the exact commit has successful merge-group evidence (or
a complete main fallback), and the reviewed PR head passed its stable ready-PR
gate. Current user-owned-repository merges use the complete main fallback because
the merge commit rewrites the SHA. Generic CI is reused; release-specific macOS
and Windows builds, packaging,
signing, notarization, SBOM, architecture/signature inspection, HEIC/launch
smoke, artifact upload, checksums/provenance where configured, and prerelease
publication remain mandatory.

Windows ships two architecture-qualified NSIS installers — `overlook-windows-x64`
and `overlook-windows-arm64` (arm64 cross-compiled on the x64 runner) — each gated
post-build by `verify-windows-arch.mjs`, which fails the leg if any payload
(`Overlook.exe` or a shipped `*.node`) is not the target PE machine type.

Signing is env-gated on repository secrets: `CSC_LINK` plus `APPLE_API_KEY` signs
and notarizes the mac build; `AZURE_TENANT_ID` / `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` /
`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` drive Azure Trusted Signing for the Windows installers
(verified with `signtool`; see [`SIGNING.md`](../SIGNING.md)); restricted Touch ID
identity entitlements are included only when `MAC_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` is also
present and validated.

Every tag publishes as a GitHub prerelease regardless of signing availability.
Each clickable mac and Windows installer asset is labeled `signed` or `unsigned`
from its own platform gate; signing state never changes the release title or
prerelease status. The macOS release gate extracts the generated ZIP and launches
it in an isolated smoke mode. Never hand-tag releases or invoke Changesets
versioning directly.
