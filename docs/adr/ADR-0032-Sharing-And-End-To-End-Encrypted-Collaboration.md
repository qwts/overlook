# ADR-0032: Sharing and End-to-End Encrypted Collaboration

## Status

Accepted 2026-07-29 on

[#518](https://github.com/qwts/overlook/issues/518),
[#509](https://github.com/qwts/overlook/issues/509), and
[#517](https://github.com/qwts/overlook/issues/517), and records the
custody decisions that
[#519](https://github.com/qwts/overlook/issues/519) surfaced as blocking.

Section map: §1 governs participant and device identity; §2 governs #517's
keyring; §3 the shared namespace; §4 invitations and capabilities; §5 the
record log and conflicts; §6 governs #509's disclosure policy; §7 revocation,
leave, delete, and recovery; §8 the threat model that binds all of them.

Implementation may choose table, channel, and service names. No child issue may
change the identities, capability semantics, disclosure classes, enforcement
boundary, or revocation limits recorded here without an ADR amendment.

## Context

Overlook's entire security story assumes exactly one custody holder. The master
key is sealed to one OS keychain, every blob is sealed under one library key
lineage, the database is one SQLCipher file, and the only remote namespace is a
backup mirror of ciphertext nobody else is meant to read. Collaboration breaks
each of those assumptions at once:

- a second person needs a key, and ADR-0004's hierarchy has no tier below the
  library key to give them;
- a photo readable by a peer cannot keep its metadata in plaintext database
  columns, or the per-item key protects nothing that matters;
- the backup namespace and its credentials are a private mirror. Reusing either
  for shared objects would put another participant's writes inside the user's
  disaster-recovery custody;
- comments and concurrent edits arrive out of order from devices that were
  offline, so delivery order cannot decide meaning;
- "share this photo" is a disclosure decision about dozens of metadata fields,
  and today no layer below the renderer knows which fields may leave;
- revocation in an end-to-end encrypted system cannot retract plaintext a
  recipient already holds, and the product must say so rather than imply
  otherwise.

The cluster needs one contract before keyring, disclosure, or collaboration
work begins.

## Decision

### 1. Participants and devices are cryptographic identities, not accounts

A **participant identity** is a long-lived Ed25519 signing keypair plus an
X25519 agreement keypair. It is **profile-scoped**, sealed by `safeStorage`
under the per-profile directory beside `provider-auth/` and `llm-auth/`
(ADR-0018 §7) — outside every library directory and outside every backup
surface by construction.

A **device identity** is a per-installation Ed25519 subkey signed by the
participant identity. Records are signed by the device key; the roster trusts
the participant key. Losing one device revokes one subkey, not the identity.

A participant is displayed by a **fingerprint** — SHA-256 over the public
signing key, rendered in ADR-0008's grouped human-checkable format — plus a
user-chosen local nickname that is never transmitted. There is no account, no
directory, no discovery, and no server that knows a participant exists.
Verification is out of band; until a fingerprint is confirmed, the participant
shows as unverified in every surface that names it.

The participant secret is **not** recoverable from ADR-0004's recovery phrase,
because it does not live in the library. It is exportable through its own
explicit one-time ceremony using the ADR-0008 key-file format. A profile
restored without that export keeps read access to every space whose key the
keyring restored, but mints a **new** authorship identity that peers must
re-verify before accepting its writes. This is a designed consequence: identity
continuity is a thing the user must deliberately carry, not a thing the backup
provider silently holds.

### 2. Item keys are the third tier of the key hierarchy

ADR-0004's hierarchy becomes master key → versioned library keys → **item and
space keys**. The `keys` table gains `kind` (`library | item | space`), a
non-secret 128-bit `key_ref`, `version`, `fingerprint`, user `label`, `origin`
(`local | imported | received`), and `wrap_scheme`. Envelope headers already
carry a key id; they now carry `(key_ref, version)`.

Resolution is library-scoped: reading any encrypted object resolves its
`key_ref` through the keyring. A miss is not an error state to be papered
over — **`locked` is a first-class item state**. A locked item may show only
key-independent facts: that it exists, its ciphertext size, its key fingerprint
and label, and when it entered the library. Filename, EXIF, place, tags,
thumbnails, and search text are unavailable, because they are not stored in
readable form.

That last point is a schema consequence, stated so #517 cannot implement around
it: **an item sealed under a key other than the library key does not keep
plaintext metadata columns.** ADR-0005's per-photo columns remain the storage
for ordinary library-key items. A foreign-key item stores its metadata as a
sealed document under its own item key, with only key-independent columns in
the row. When the key resolves, a decrypted projection is materialized into a
cache table inside the same SQLCipher database so search, filters, and counts
keep working; the projection is dropped when the key is removed or app lock
releases it (ADR-0013). Otherwise a per-item key would protect the pixels and
publish the story.

Custody follows ADR-0004 exactly: imported and received keys are wrapped by the
master key, plaintext key material exists only in `KeyStore` memory, nothing
plaintext is ever written to the database or a log, and app lock zeroizes.

Keyring ceremonies:

- **Import** accepts a key file or pasted key, validates it against at least
  one addressable object, and records label, fingerprint, and usage count. A
  duplicate import is idempotent. A key matching nothing in this library is
  refused with that exact reason, not stored hopefully.
- **Rotation** mints a new version that becomes the write key for that key's
  domain. Existing objects stay on their sealing version — ADR-0004's rotation
  decision carried forward unchanged, and stated in-product.
- **Removal** is Tier M under ADR-0023 when other custody exists, and Tier D
  with the full ceremony and exact counts when it would strand the only
  decryptable custody for any item.
- **Backup manifests reference `(key_ref, version)` and never secrets.**
  Imported and received keys are keyring entries, so ADR-0004 recovery restores
  them with the master key; a manifest generation that names a key the restored
  keyring lacks yields locked items, never a failed restore.

### 3. Shared spaces are a separate namespace with separate credentials

A **space** is a ULID with its own space key lineage, signed roster, record
log, and blob namespace. Its remote layout is a distinct root:

```
/Overlook-Shared/<space-id>/
  roster/          # signed, generation-numbered roster documents
  records/         # encrypted, authenticated append-only records
  blobs/<h2>/<h>   # encrypted originals and derivatives, space-key sealed
  keys/            # space-key versions wrapped to each participant
```

This root is never `/Overlook/<library-id>/` and never the sibling product's
root (ADR-0007's writer-isolation stance applies unchanged). **Backup
credentials are never reused for a space.** A space holds its own provider
connection record, may live on a provider the library does not back up to, and
its provider is selected from ADR-0011's capability descriptors — a space host
needs `put`/`get`/`list`/`delete` but no checksum call, because record
integrity comes from signatures rather than provider attestation.

A space is not backup, in both directions. Sharing a photo never makes it
recoverable, never sets `synced`, and never satisfies ADR-0007 offload
eligibility. Conversely a photo's custody state — offloaded, local-only,
excluded from backup — is private and is never published into a space.

Sharing re-seals bytes. An ADR-0031 original asset entering a space is
re-encrypted under the space key into the space blob namespace, addressed by an
HMAC of the plaintext hash under the space key so equality is visible only
inside that space. ADR-0007's encrypt-once rule deliberately does not cross
this boundary: handing a peer the library envelope would mean handing over the
library key. One extra ciphertext copy per shared original is the accepted cost
of end-to-end encryption, recorded here rather than discovered later in a
storage-total bug report.

### 4. Capabilities are granted independently on a signed roster

An **invitation** is an out-of-band bundle carrying the space id, a provider
locator, the current space key version wrapped either to the invitee's X25519
public key or, when no public key is known yet, under an ADR-0008 KDF-derived
passphrase; plus the inviter's fingerprint, the offered capability set, an
expiry, and a single-use nonce. Nothing about an invitation transits a service
Overlook operates, because Overlook operates none.

Capabilities are `read`, `comment`, and `edit`, granted independently and
non-implied: `edit` does not confer `comment`. `admin` — the right to change
the roster — is held by the creator and may be granted explicitly.

The **roster** is a generation-numbered document listing participant keys,
capabilities, and grant provenance, signed by an `admin` participant. Every
record is validated against the roster generation in force at its position in
the log.

Enforcement is honest about where it lives:

- **Read is enforced by key possession.** Without a space key version, the
  bytes are opaque.
- **Write is enforced by signature validation at every reader.** The provider
  is dumb storage and enforces nothing. A removed participant who kept an old
  space key can still upload objects the provider accepts; every conforming
  reader rejects them because the roster no longer grants the capability, and
  the space surfaces them as rejected rather than hiding them.
- Readers bound record count and size per participant per generation and report
  a space that exceeds its limits, rather than downloading without limit.

### 5. Records are append-only, authenticated, and reviewed on conflict

Record types are `photo`, `variant` (an ADR-0031 revision document),
`metadata` (shared-class fields only, §6), `comment`, `roster`, and
`tombstone`.

Each record carries the space id, a record ULID, the author participant and
device, a per-participant sequence number, and its causal parents. The payload
is sealed with ADR-0004's chunked AES-256-GCM envelope under the space key,
with AAD binding space id, record id, record type, author, and roster
generation; the sealed record is then signed by the author's device key.
Replay, cross-space substitution, author swapping, and truncation all fail
closed.

The log is append-only. An edit is a new record; a deletion is a tombstone.
Nothing is rewritten in place, so a peer that was offline for a month replays
rather than reconciles.

Offline writes queue in an encrypted local outbox with explicit durable states
— `queued | uploading | delivered | rejected | conflicted` — surfaced with the
same honesty as the backup ledger's failure vocabulary. A record is never shown
as delivered before the provider acknowledged it.

Conflict resolution is by type, never by arrival order. Comments are
commutative and cannot conflict. Roster generations are totally ordered by
`admin` signature and generation number. Shared metadata fields and variant
edit heads follow ADR-0015's deterministic reviewed-journal rules: concurrent
heads are surfaced for explicit review, with authorship and time shown, and
last-writer-wins is not available as a silent default.

### 6. Every field has a disclosure class, compiled below the renderer

Each metadata field carries exactly one class:

- **private** — never crosses a disclosure boundary;
- **shared** — may cross to named, authorized recipients;
- **public** — may cross to an unauthenticated destination.

Local use is not disclosure. Private fields remain fully indexed, searchable,
filterable, and actionable on device; classification governs export, interop,
space records, diagnostics, language-model requests, and external indexes only.

A **pinned-private set** cannot be reclassified by any preference at any scope:
key material and `key_ref` values, recovery state, blob addresses and plaintext
content hashes, protected-album existence, names, and counts (ADR-0013),
app-lock state, provider credentials and account identifiers, per-photo custody
and backup-coverage state, biometric-derived data, diagnostics identifiers
(ADR-0021), and participant device secrets.

Defaults for the classifiable set: title, description, tags, capture time,
camera, lens, and ADR-0031 provenance evidence default to **shared**; precise
location, ratings, and face data default to **private**; nothing defaults to
public. Comments are shared within their space and are not exportable to a
public destination by default.

Scope resolves library → collection → photo → operation. Narrowing is allowed
at any level; widening requires an explicit action at that level and is never
inherited downward as a silent default.

Enforcement is a single `src/shared` policy module that compiles a
**disclosure plan** — the exact field set, per recipient, for one boundary
crossing. The main process recomputes the plan and builds the payload from it;
the renderer supplies intent, never a field list. A stale renderer, a replayed
IPC call, or a direct channel invocation therefore cannot widen disclosure,
which is the same process-trust posture ADR-0023 §6 applies to destructive
authorization.

Before any disclosure the user sees an exact preview: which fields, which
values, which destination or recipient, and what changes if they decline.
Policy versions and consent changes are recorded in ADR-0025 activity history
**by field name and class only** — recording the value would defeat the point.

Backup is not a disclosure boundary. It is ciphertext under the user's own
keys, so no classification applies to it and no setting can reclassify backup
content as shared or public.

### 7. Revocation is forward-only, and the product says so

**Removing a participant** advances the roster generation with a signed removal,
mints a new space key version, and wraps it to the remaining participants. All
subsequent records seal under the new version. Records already downloaded, and
records still sealed under an old version the removed participant holds, remain
readable to them.

The ceremony copy is fixed by that fact: _"Removing them stops them from
reading anything shared from now on. It cannot delete or un-see anything they
already have."_ No surface may imply cryptographic retraction.

**Leaving** a space deletes the local space keys, records, outbox, and space
blob copies, and optionally publishes a departure tombstone. Records the
leaver authored remain in the log, because other participants hold them.

**Deleting a space** is Tier D under ADR-0023: it removes the remote objects
through the provider's recoverable deletion (the #750 amendment applies
unchanged), removes local copies, and discloses that other participants keep
whatever they downloaded. It never claims to erase a peer's device.

**Purge interaction.** ADR-0023 §4's derived-death list gains space membership
rows, outbox entries, space blob copies, cached foreign-key metadata
projections, and per-photo disclosure decisions. ADR-0023 §6's side-effect
enumeration gains one line whenever the purged photo was shared: copies held by
other participants are not deleted.

**Recovery.** Space and item keys restore with the keyring (§2). The
participant identity does not (§1). A restored library therefore reaches
`read` immediately and `comment`/`edit` only after peers re-verify the new
identity — stated in the restore flow, not discovered when a comment is
rejected.

### 8. Threat model

**Protects against:** the provider operator and anyone with provider
credentials; a network observer, beyond object sizes, counts, and timing; other
OS users without the keychain session; a removed participant's _future_ reads;
tampered, replayed, reordered, or forged records; a stale or compromised
renderer attempting to widen disclosure.

**Does not protect against:** a compromised participant device, or a
participant who chooses to leak; plaintext a recipient already downloaded;
traffic analysis of object count, size, and timing; a malicious inviter
presenting a fingerprint they do not control — out-of-band verification is the
only defense and the UI must say so; metadata the user classified as shared;
a compromised OS or session on any participant's machine.

**Deliberately not built:** public link sharing, discovery or a social graph,
server-side moderation or indexing, key escrow, and any "unsend" affordance.
Each is excluded because it would either require a service that can see
participants or a promise the cryptography cannot keep.

## Consequences

- ADR-0004's hierarchy grows a tier and every envelope read becomes a keyring
  resolution. `locked` becomes a state the whole renderer must handle, not an
  error path.
- Per-item keys force a second metadata storage shape. Ordinary library-key
  photos keep ADR-0005's columns; foreign-key items pay a sealed document plus
  a droppable projection, and search behavior becomes key-availability
  dependent.
- Sharing costs a second ciphertext copy per original. Storage totals, offload
  accounting, and purge disclosure all have to name space copies separately
  from backup copies.
- Disclosure moves from a renderer concern to a compiled plan in `src/shared`,
  which makes every existing boundary — export, interop, diagnostics,
  language-model requests — a consumer that must be retrofitted.
- The product gains a permanent honesty obligation: revocation is forward-only,
  invitations are only as trustworthy as the fingerprint check, and no copy may
  soften either.
- #517 implements §2; #509 implements §6; #518 implements §1 and §3–§5 and
  consumes §7–§8 for its recovery and threat documentation. #519's key-custody
  question is answered for sharing only — a native-platform port still needs
  its own ADR before reusing §1's custody shape.
- **Revisit when:** a participant count beyond small-group sharing makes
  wrap-per-participant key distribution impractical; or a credible
  provider-neutral transport removes the need for a shared blob namespace at
  all.
