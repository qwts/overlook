# M07: Export

**Epic:** [#42](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/42) · **Lane:** Lane B — Core

Lane B. The counterpart to encrypted storage: exporting writes real, openable files. ExportDialog per the design — format segmented (Original/JPEG), **"Decrypt originals" switch on by default; turning it off disables Export and shows the amber warning** ("exported files can't be opened outside Overlook"), destination picker, running progress ("Decrypting & writing" vs "Writing"), done summary. Entry points: multi-select action pill and the lightbox export icon (count=1).

| Export All Unencrypted resolves every ordinary, non-trashed library photo in main, retains original formats, and reports individual failures | 🚧 #885           | `tests/db/library-db.test.ts` + `tests/export/export-runtime.test.ts` + `ExportDialog.stories.tsx`                  |

Recorded decisions: v1 ships no encrypted-export format (decrypt-off just disables Export); transcode quality 90; EXIF/GPS stripped on transcode — metadata travels only with Original exports.
