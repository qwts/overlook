# E2E & Storybook Timing Audit

Checked-in inventory of every wall-clock wait in the Playwright-Electron E2E
suite and the Storybook interaction lane, with the synchronization contract
each one depends on. Written for [#630](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/630)
(deterministic E2E synchronization) and kept current when timing waits are
added or changed — a new `test.setTimeout`, assertion timeout, sleep, or
product-timer wait belongs in the matching table below in the same PR.

The governing rule (issue non-goals): **a larger wall-clock budget cannot make
a missed event observable.** Increase a timeout only after identifying the
condition that stalled; classify every wait as one of four kinds and give it
the synchronization it actually needs.

## The four categories

1. **Product-time behavior** — the elapsed time _is_ the thing under test
   (toast auto-dismiss, chrome idle-autohide). The only correct wait is real
   or deterministically-advanced time. Candidates for a controllable clock.
2. **Readiness synchronization** — waiting for the app/renderer/layout to
   reach a state (launch ready, window reload complete, image decoded, layout
   settled). Must synchronize on a semantic signal, never a guessed duration.
3. **Operation completion** — waiting for background work to finish (import,
   backup, restore, offload, IPC round-trip). Synchronize on the app's own
   completion signal (status text, sync state, IPC resolution) under a bound
   sized to the work.
4. **Teardown** — app close and worker cleanup. Must be bounded so a stalled
   close cannot escalate into an unowned worker-teardown timeout.

## Shared fixture (categories 2 & 4)

`tests/e2e/support/app.ts` — `launchOverlook` runs the launch lifecycle through
named, individually-bounded stages (`electron-launch` → `first-window` →
`renderer-ready`); a stall reports **which** stage was missed plus window/
process state and a renderer console tail, instead of consuming the whole test
budget with a bare "Test timeout". Fixture teardown closes every launched
instance with a bounded, force-kill-backed `close` (category 4), so a
timed-out test can no longer leave `app.close()` hanging into Playwright's
30 s worker-teardown timeout — the failure mode that replaced the original red
with an unowned teardown error even when the retry passed.

`expectRendererReload` arms the `framenavigated` listener **before** triggering
an in-place reload (active-library move, app-lock relock), then requires the
renderer to re-reach its ready marker — replacing the raced
`firstWindow()` + bare `waitFor` that could observe the pre-reload document and
stall (the `library-relocation` 90 s failures on `main`). `appExited` bounds
the wait for a fault-injected process to die, with the exit signal captured at
launch so it is safe to await after the process is already gone.

Migrated onto the fixture: `library-relocation`, `albums`, `lightbox`,
`album-drag-drop`, `keyboard-navigation`, `offload-ui`. Those are the known failure classes
named by #630. Remaining hand-rolled launches are tracked as mechanical fixture
adoption; they do not use one-shot reload events and are outside the missed
lifecycle class this issue set out to close.

## Per-test budgets — `test.setTimeout` (category mix)

Each budget must be justified by the **sum of the bounded waits inside the
test**, not padded past a symptom. The 30 s config default
(`playwright.config.ts`) is correct only for tests whose bounded-wait sum fits
inside it; the tests below document why they exceed it.

The two entries called out in bold — `album-management` and `lightbox
transform` — are the tests that repeatedly hit the 30 s default **exactly**:
their bounded-wait sums always exceeded 30 s, so any CI contention pushed them
over. The budget bumps make the contract explicit; they are not blanket raises.

## Operation-completion waits — assertion timeouts (category 3)

Synchronize on the app's own completion signal under a bound sized to the work.

- **Import/encrypt** (`{timeout: 30_000}`): import-flow:80/163/254,
  export-flow:119/156/194/232, external-open:187, import-flow:144/220 (custody
  move). Signal: "N photos imported and encrypted" / custody-verification text.
- **Export/decrypt** (`{timeout: 20_000}`): export-flow:85/133/177/215. Signal:
  "N photos exported and decrypted".
- **Backup completion** (`{timeout: 20_000}`): backup:45/61/151/232,
  albums:26/138/166/184, trash:130/131, offload-ui:41. Signal: "ALL BACKED UP"
  / "BACKUP COMPLETE".
- **Key ceremony, scrypt-bound** (`{timeout: 30_000}`): keys-recovery:52/79/84,
  protected-albums:42/70/110/122/137/155/168.
- **Restore** (`{timeout: 30_000}` poll): restore-cloud:148 (`library.db`
  exists). **Large import ready** (`{timeout: 15_000}`): external-open:155.
- **Auto-backup sync** (`{timeout: 15_000}` poll): import-flow:112–117
  (`syncState` → all `'synced'`).
- **Layout settle after large seed** (`{timeout: 30_000}` decode /
  `{timeout: 15_000}` scrollHeight poll): backup:88/90–96.

`expect.poll` with the default 5 s bound (window count, menu state, settings
push, gesture/animation settle, image decode via `naturalWidth`) is used
throughout — acceptable because each polls a semantic predicate, not a clock.
The 200% zoom reachability checks in `visual-accessibility.spec.ts` poll the
strict target rectangle until every edge is inside the renderer viewport. This
synchronizes zoom-triggered layout and the Lightbox `ResizeObserver`: at narrow
container widths the initial toolbar placement is intentionally transient, but
the zero-edge accessibility bounds are never relaxed.

## Product-time behavior — real elapsed time (category 1)

These wait for a **product timer**; the elapsed time is the behavior under
test. The import-toast flow installs Playwright's renderer clock before the
toast is created and advances it explicitly. The remaining cases are documented
exceptions: Storybook `play` functions do not receive Playwright's page clock,
while lightbox/app-lock/a11y exercise composed Electron behavior across renderer
lifecycle or CSS-animation boundaries. They synchronize on semantic state.

| location                  | product timer                               | current wait                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| import-flow:95            | toast 4 s auto-dismiss (#411)               | `page.clock.fastForward(4_200)` (deterministic)       |
| lightbox:304              | lightbox chrome idle-autohide               | `toHaveAttribute('data-chrome','off',{timeout:5000})` |

| app-lock:99/153           | unlock re-enable throttle                   | `toBeVisible({timeout:3_000})`                        |
| a11y:157–166              | 120 ms bg transition settle                 | `.poll` running-animations == 0                       |
| Lightbox.stories:110      | 2.2 s chrome idle window                    | `waitFor({timeout:4000})`                             |
| Toast.stories:121/147/161 | `autoDismissMs` 200/400 + hover/focus pause | `setTimeout(400/600)` + `waitFor({timeout:2000})`     |
| ExportDialog.stories:18   | simulated export progress cadence           | `setTimeout(40)` ×3                                   |

## Event-driven waits (not time-based)

Hand-rolled `new Promise` resolved by an event, not a timer — correct as-is,
listed for completeness: settings.spec:50 (`settings.onChanged` IPC push),
seeded-library:58/65 & app-lock:78 (`Image.onload/onerror` over
`overlook-thumb://`). The `app.process().once('exit')` waits in relocation and
library-switch are now the fixture's `appExited` helper.

## Harness bounds (outer envelope)

- `scripts/run-guarded.mjs` wraps every test entrypoint with a wall-clock
  timeout: `test:e2e` runs at `--timeout-s 1800` (30 min whole-run). A
  guard kill is a real failure — see [agent-process-guard](agent-process-guard.md).
- `playwright.config.ts`: per-test `timeout: 30_000`, `expect.timeout: 5_000`,
  CI `workers: 1`, CI `retries: 0`, `fullyParallel: false` (spec files run
  concurrently, tests within a file serially).
- `global-setup.ts` builds the app once before workers start; `global-teardown.ts`
  sweeps the run-scoped temp-dir registry with a `retryDelay: 100`/`maxRetries: 3`
  tolerance for Electron releasing the userData lock just after `app.close()`.

## Runner capacity (category 4 scope §4 of #630)

`scripts/measure-runner-capacity.mjs` wraps the guarded E2E entrypoint in CI and
records elapsed time, logical/available CPUs, memory, normalized load, and Linux
CPU/I/O pressure samples. The process-tree guard remains the source for peak RSS
and process count. Manual `workflow_dispatch` inputs select one, two, or three
workers and zero retries, producing a retained `runner-capacity-*` artifact for
each comparison. Ordinary required runs use one worker and zero retries.

Capacity verdicts compare artifacts from the same commit and runner image. A
normalized-load or pressure peak alone does not justify a larger runner: worker
count changes only when lower concurrency improves no-retry reliability enough
to outweigh wall time.

The closure comparison on commit `72631d5` used the same `ubuntu-latest` image
and disabled retries throughout. One worker passed all 86 tests in 4 min 51 s.
Two workers completed in 3 min 12 s but failed `offload-ui` once (82 passed,
3 skipped); the focused test then passed 20/20 guarded local repetitions. The
three-worker result and telemetry are linked from the issue's closing evidence.
Because the higher-concurrency miss did not reproduce locally, the required lane
chooses the stable one-worker baseline and removes retries instead of hiding a
miss. Retained JSON artifacts supply load, memory, and Linux CPU/I/O pressure;
the process guard supplies aggregate RSS and process count.
