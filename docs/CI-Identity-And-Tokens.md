# CI Identity And Tokens

Which identity performs a repository write, and which token may reach which
step. `AGENTS.md` carries the one-line rule; this page carries the reasoning and
the failure modes, so the rule is followable when something breaks.

## Bot identities, not human PATs

**Anything that must start another workflow run authenticates as
`chores-dumb[bot]`** — branch and tag pushes, bot-opened PRs, and
`gh workflow run`. It is a GitHub App whose installation token is minted per run
from `CHORES_DUMB_CLIENT_ID` / `CHORES_DUMB_PRIVATE_KEY` by
`actions/create-github-app-token`. Privileged writes have no PAT or
`GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback.

A bot rather than a human PAT, for a concrete reason: a PAT opens the version PR
as `qwts`, who cannot approve their own PR, so every release cut needed a ruleset
bypass. Repository chores get a bot identity; agents get their own Apps, and the
two never share one.

## Why `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not enough

`GITHUB_TOKEN` events normally trigger no downstream workflows. Governed CI also
rejects `github-actions[bot]` in the immutable policy job. That is why a separate
App identity exists at all.

## Token blast radius

Repository credentials must be **absent while third-party tools run**: checkouts
that precede them use `persist-credentials: false`, and tokens are injected only
into first-party steps containing the `git` / `gh` commands that need them.

**The App credential may reach only `actions/*` steps and our own `run:` blocks
— never a third-party action**, whose future versions nobody here controls. When a
third-party action is the only thing standing between the App credential and the
run you need, replace it or drop it. Two precedents:

- versioning is a script in `version-cut.yml` rather than `changesets/action`,
  for exactly this reason;
- the E2E-report Pages publish was deleted rather than handed the token.

## Agent identity

Each agent worktree runs as its own `<slug>[bot]` App installation, minted by the
`WorktreeCreate` hook in `.claude/settings.json`
([ENG-0016](https://github.com/qwts/playbook-engineering/blob/master/docs/decisions/ENG-0016-agent-pr-bot-identity.md)).
`git` and `gh` are the only sanctioned write paths: a GitHub MCP connector
carries the human's OAuth and bypasses both, so a PR appearing as `qwts` despite
a working shim means a connector made it. Agent checkouts use **HTTPS remotes**,
because an SSH remote authenticates the push with the human's key regardless of
`GH_TOKEN`.

Commits created with `git commit` in a bot worktree cannot be Verified — the
worktree deliberately sets `commit.gpgsign=false`, since signing a bot's commit
with a human key shows Unverified. The signed-commit skill replays commits
through the Git Data API, which GitHub signs server-side.

## Merge automation

GitHub's native merge queue is organization-only, so this user-owned repository
keeps `.github/workflows/auto-update-prs.yml`. After a `main` push, PR open, or
ready transition, the workflow uses `chores-dumb[bot]` to merge current `main`
into each eligible ready branch through the update-branch API. The resulting
`synchronize` event runs the complete suite, and strict required checks prevent
auto-merge from landing stale evidence.

The final merge commit has a new SHA, so it is not treated as the validated PR
head. Its `main` push therefore runs the complete-suite fallback plus
default-branch CodeQL. The `merge_group` lane and the shared policy action's
narrow merge-queue actor exception remain dormant compatibility for a future
transfer to an organization; they do not justify skipping exact-commit checks.

Consequences worth knowing before touching a branch:

- **Never manually rebase, merge `main` in, or "update" a branch that is merely
  behind `main`**. Resolve genuine conflicts on the source branch; otherwise the
  updater owns branch freshness.
- Dependabot branches are excluded; use `@dependabot rebase` before the normal
  ready complete-suite and review lifecycle.
- After any update that changes `package-lock.json`, run `npm ci` before trusting
  local gates. A stale install fails E2E in ways that look like flakes; an
  Electron bump landing mid-session produced two identical timeout failures this
  way.
- Auto-merge uses merge commits. The ruleset retains strict status checks,
  approval, CODEOWNERS, and resolved review threads.

## Workflow actor boundary

The immutable playbook CI-policy action permits only `qwts`,
`chores-dumb[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, and active `<agent-slug>[bot]` Apps from
the governed roster. It checks both `github.actor` and
`github.triggering_actor`; credentials do not grant actor authorization. The one
system exception requires both actor fields to be `github-merge-queue[bot]`, the
event to be `push`, and the ref to be `refs/heads/main`. That exception cannot
authorize PR, queue-candidate, manual, tag, or non-main events and is dormant in
this user-owned repository. Public-fork runs are never approved.

Every direct non-CI entrypoint runs that same immutable action in
authorization-only mode before checkout, credential minting, or repository
work. This covers the branch updater, Package, Perf, version-cut, release, and
close-linked-issues; their reusable children inherit the gated caller event. A
new direct trigger is incomplete until its policy job and dependency edge exist.

## Manual repository rollout

These settings cannot be supplied by pull-request code and must be applied only
after the replacement contexts first report successfully:

1. Keep **Actions → Policies → Workflow execution protections** disabled. The
   preview picker cannot express event-scoped GitHub system exceptions, while
   using the Write role would authorize unrelated current and future writers.
   Require approval for all external-contributor workflows, never approve
   public-fork runs, keep the default workflow token read-only, and retain the
   action-source allowlist and full-SHA pinning.
2. Switch **Advanced Security → CodeQL analysis** from default to Advanced
   after a manual CI run proves both configured languages and the stable
   `CodeQL` context. Do not leave a gap in code-scanning enforcement.
3. Require `CI`, `E2E`, `E2E gate`, `Docs governance / docs-gov`, and `CodeQL`.
   Bind `CodeQL` to the GitHub Advanced Security App and the other four contexts
   to GitHub Actions — never to `chores-dumb`, which initiates privileged writes
   but does not publish check runs. Retain the CodeQL code-scanning and
   code-quality rules. Remove an obsolete default-setup context only after its
   Advanced replacement reports successfully.
4. Retain strict status checks, approval, CODEOWNERS, resolved-thread
   requirements, auto-merge, and merge commits. Keep the governed branch updater
   enabled until the repository is transferred to an organization; only then may
   a native `MERGE` queue replace it after exact-SHA validation is proven.

No secret is added merely for actor authorization. The existing `CHORES_DUMB`
credentials remain required by the governed branch updater and version/tag
automation; `RELEASE_TOKEN` is not consumed by those privileged writes.
