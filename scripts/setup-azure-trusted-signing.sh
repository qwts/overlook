# Run this yourself in a shell where you've already run `az login`. It walks
# the account/profile lookup, creates a service principal scoped to sign with
# that profile, and writes the three secrets to the repo via `gh secret set`.
#
# Prereqs:
#   - az CLI, plus the `trustedsigning` extension (installed below)
#   - gh CLI authenticated with admin on the repo (to set secrets)
#   - An Azure Trusted Signing account (portal: "Trusted Signing Accounts")
#   - Completed Identity Validation on that account — see step 2; this is a
#     real identity review by Microsoft and cannot be scripted.
#
# Every step below that looks gratuitous is here because it bit us during the
# real setup; the comments say which failure each one prevents.

#   - Public Trust chains to a publicly trusted root, which is what a public
#     download needs. Private Trust only validates inside a private PKI.
#   - Individual verifies you personally. The Organization path is what asks
#     for a DUNS number; individuals do not need one.

# Identity Verifier' role assigned" until the role below is granted TO YOU
# (the human), which is separate from the signing role granted to the service
# principal further down.
